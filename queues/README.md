# Queue : 
### Queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a First-In/First Out(FIFO) manner

<hr/>

### *Queue Operations* : 

1. Enqueue : Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.

2. Deque :  It removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition
 
3. Front : It gives the front item from the queue.

4. Rear : It gives the last item from the queue.
